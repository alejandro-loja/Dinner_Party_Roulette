 ## Group Project 1


This project object is to show the use of APIs in order to create and application.
Specifically, in this project I was responsible for the Spoonacular API AJAX calls and well as most
of the JavaScript. 

We decided to make an app that gives you a random meal based on certain parameters.
We used the Spooncular API to generate recepie results. We also used the Giphy API to
show generate random images based on the search criteria.

The recipe output shows you the title, the list of ingredients, and the insturctions of the recipe.
